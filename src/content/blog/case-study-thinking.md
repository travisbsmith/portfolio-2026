## Beyond Pretty Pictures

Every week, I review portfolios from designers hoping to join our team. The ones that stand out aren't always the most visually polished. They're the ones that clearly demonstrate **how the designer thinks**.

Here's my framework for creating case studies that showcase your thinking.

## The STAR Framework for Design

I borrow from the classic STAR interview format, adapted for design:

- **Situation**: What was the context? Business goals, constraints, team composition.
- **Task**: What were you specifically responsible for?
- **Action**: What did you do? This is where process lives.
- **Result**: What happened? Quantify where possible.

Most case studies I see are heavy on Action (process porn) and light on Situation and Result. Balance is key.

## Show Your Constraints

Real design happens within constraints. Budget, timeline, technical limitations, organizational politics—these are the realities of the job.

Don't hide your constraints. Embrace them:

> "We had 3 weeks, one engineer, and a legacy codebase that couldn't support custom components. Here's how we delivered impact anyway."

This is more impressive than a fantasy project with unlimited resources.

## Be Honest About Your Role

Nothing frustrates hiring managers more than unclear ownership. If you were one of five designers on a project, say so. Explain specifically what you contributed.

Good: "I led the research phase and designed the onboarding flow. Worked closely with another designer who focused on the dashboard."

Bad: "We redesigned the entire product."

## Show Dead Ends

The final design is polished. But what about the seven versions that didn't work? The approaches you tried and abandoned?

Including failed attempts shows:
- You explore before committing
- You can evaluate your own work critically
- You iterate based on feedback

## Quantify Your Impact

"Improved the user experience" is meaningless. What specifically improved, and how do you know?

Strong signals:
- Conversion increased by X%
- Support tickets decreased by Y%
- Task completion time reduced from A to B minutes
- NPS improved from X to Y

If you don't have hard metrics, qualitative feedback counts:
- User research quotes
- Stakeholder testimonials
- Team feedback

## Structure for Scannability

Recruiters and hiring managers are busy. They're scanning, not reading.

Make your case studies scannable:
- Clear headlines for each section
- Key takeaways in bold or callouts
- Visual hierarchy that guides the eye
- Summary at the top for those who won't read further

## A Template to Start From

1. **Overview** (2-3 sentences): What was the project? What was your role?
2. **Context**: Business situation, goals, constraints
3. **Challenge**: The specific problem you were solving
4. **Process**: How you approached it (research, ideation, iteration)
5. **Solution**: What you shipped (with visuals)
6. **Results**: Impact and learnings
7. **Reflection**: What you'd do differently

Your portfolio is an artifact of your thinking. Make it easy for people to understand not just what you made, but how you approach problems.

That's what gets you hired.
