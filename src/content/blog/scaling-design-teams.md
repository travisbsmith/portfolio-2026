## The Challenge of Growth

When I joined Grubhub, the design team was 5 people. By the time I moved on, we were over 50. That growth brought incredible opportunities—and significant challenges.

The hardest part wasn't hiring. It wasn't even maintaining design quality. **The hardest part was keeping the culture that made us great in the first place.**

## What Changes (and What Shouldn't)

As teams grow, certain things naturally change:

- **Communication patterns** shift from informal to structured
- **Decision-making** becomes more distributed
- **Onboarding** requires more intentional design

But some things should remain constant:

- **Values** that define how we work
- **Psychological safety** that enables risk-taking
- **Craft standards** that ensure quality

## Three Principles That Guided Our Growth

### 1. Hire for Culture Add, Not Culture Fit

The phrase "culture fit" can be a trap. It often leads to homogeneous teams that lack diverse perspectives. Instead, I look for people who will **add** to our culture—bringing new ideas while sharing our core values.

Questions I ask:
- What's a belief you hold about design that might be controversial?
- Tell me about a time you changed someone's mind about a design decision.
- How do you give feedback to someone more senior than you?

### 2. Document the Implicit

When you're a small team, a lot of knowledge is implicit. Everyone just *knows* how things work. That breaks down at scale.

We invested heavily in documentation:
- **Design principles** that guide decision-making
- **Critique protocols** that ensure productive feedback
- **Career ladders** that clarify expectations

### 3. Create Space for Connection

As teams grow, it's easy to silo. We fought this by creating intentional spaces for cross-team connection:

- Weekly design shares where anyone could present work-in-progress
- Monthly design challenges (purely for fun and learning)
- Quarterly offsites focused on team building, not just strategy

## The Metrics That Matter

I tracked three things obsessively:

1. **Team health surveys** - Anonymous quarterly surveys on psychological safety, growth, and satisfaction
2. **Retention rates** - High performers staying is a signal of healthy culture
3. **Cross-team collaboration** - Were teams working together, or building walls?

## What I'd Do Differently

Looking back, I'd spend more time upfront on:

- **Leadership development** - Training managers earlier, not when they're already struggling
- **Design ops investment** - Dedicated people to handle tools, processes, and systems
- **Executive communication** - Helping the org understand design's value at each stage of growth

Growing a design team is one of the most rewarding challenges I've faced. It requires balancing structure with flexibility, standards with autonomy, and growth with sustainability.

The teams I've built aren't just productive—they're places where designers do the best work of their careers. That's the real measure of success.
