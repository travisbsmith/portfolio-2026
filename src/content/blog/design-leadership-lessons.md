## The Transition No One Prepares You For

Moving from individual contributor to design leader is one of the biggest career transitions you'll make. And despite all the management books and leadership courses, nothing fully prepares you for the reality.

Here are ten lessons I learned the hard way.

## 1. Your Impact Is Now Indirect

As an IC, you measure success by the work you ship. As a leader, your success is measured by the work your *team* ships. This shift takes time to internalize.

At first, I kept jumping into designs, "helping" my team by solving problems for them. I had to learn that my job was to create the conditions for their success, not to do their work.

## 2. The Best Designers Don't Always Make the Best Managers

Design skill and management skill are different competencies. I've seen brilliant designers struggle as managers, and solid (not exceptional) designers become incredible leaders.

**What matters for leadership:**
- Empathy and emotional intelligence
- Clear communication
- Ability to give and receive feedback
- Strategic thinking

## 3. You Will Make Decisions With Incomplete Information

As an IC, you can research until you feel confident. As a leader, you're often making calls with 60% of the information you'd like to have.

I had to get comfortable with uncertainty. Make the best decision you can with the information available, then adjust as you learn more.

## 4. Your Calendar Is Not Your Own

The first year of management, I was shocked at how little unscheduled time I had. 1:1s, team meetings, stakeholder syncs, hiring loops—it fills up fast.

I learned to:
- Protect focus blocks religiously
- Batch similar meetings
- Decline meetings without clear agendas

## 5. Feedback Is a Gift (That No One Wants to Give You)

As a manager, you stop getting candid feedback naturally. People are careful about what they say to their boss.

You have to actively seek feedback:
- Create psychological safety for honest input
- Ask specific questions, not "any feedback?"
- Thank people for critical feedback (even when it stings)

## 6. Hire Slowly, Fire Quickly

I was too slow to act on bad fits early in my career. Every time I waited too long to address a performance issue, the team suffered.

This doesn't mean being hasty—it means being honest. If someone isn't working out after genuine effort to help them succeed, act decisively.

## 7. Your Energy Sets the Tone

On days when I'm stressed, my team feels it. On days when I'm energized, they feel that too.

I learned to be more intentional about the energy I bring:
- Starting meetings with gratitude
- Acknowledging stress without amplifying it
- Celebrating wins, even small ones

## 8. Strategy Is Harder Than Execution

I used to think the hard part was making things. Now I know the hard part is deciding *what* to make and *why*.

Strategic thinking requires:
- Understanding business context
- Synthesizing diverse inputs
- Making hard trade-offs
- Communicating vision clearly

## 9. Your Relationship with Your Manager Changes Everything

A supportive skip-level creates room for you to lead. A difficult relationship constrains everything.

Invest in this relationship:
- Communicate proactively
- Bring solutions, not just problems
- Understand their goals and constraints

## 10. It's Worth It

Despite all the challenges, design leadership is deeply fulfilling. Watching designers grow, seeing teams create amazing work, and shaping the future of design organizations—there's nothing quite like it.

If you're considering the leap to leadership, go for it. You'll make mistakes. You'll have hard days. But you'll also have the opportunity to multiply your impact and help others do the best work of their careers.

That's worth the learning curve.
