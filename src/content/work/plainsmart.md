## Overview

PlainSmart was a direct-to-consumer startup focused on high-quality, sustainable basics. I designed their complete e-commerce experience from the ground up.

## The Challenge

As a new brand entering a competitive market, PlainSmart needed to:
- Establish brand credibility quickly
- Communicate their sustainability story
- Convert first-time visitors efficiently
- Build a foundation for growth

## Approach

### Brand Expression
Worked closely with the founding team to translate brand values into a digital experience that felt:
- Clean and purposeful (like their products)
- Trustworthy and transparent
- Premium but accessible

### Conversion Focus
Designed with a strong focus on the first-time buyer journey:
- Clear value proposition
- Social proof integration
- Streamlined checkout

## Key Features

- **Product Storytelling** - Rich product pages that communicate quality and sustainability
- **Size Guidance** - Fit finder to reduce returns
- **Subscription Option** - Easy reordering for basics

## Results

- Successfully launched and achieved sales targets in first quarter
- Lower than industry average cart abandonment rate
- Strong repeat purchase rate
