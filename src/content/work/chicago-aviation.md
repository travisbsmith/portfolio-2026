## Overview

**Agency:** VSA Partners

While at VSA Partners, I led the design of the digital passenger experience for the Chicago Department of Aviation, which manages O'Hare International Airport and Midway Airport—two of the busiest airports in the United States.

## The Challenge

Millions of passengers navigate these airports annually, facing:
- Complex terminal layouts spanning multiple concourses
- Inconsistent digital touchpoints across the airport
- Language barriers for international travelers
- Accessibility needs for diverse passenger populations

## Approach

### Research
- Conducted ethnographic research across both airports
- Interviewed passengers from diverse backgrounds and travel purposes
- Mapped the entire passenger journey from arrival to departure
- Identified pain points in current digital and physical wayfinding

### Strategy
Developed a unified digital experience strategy covering:
- Responsive websites for flychicago.com (O'Hare) and Midway
- Flight information displays and real-time updates
- Interactive wayfinding and terminal maps
- Integration with airport services (dining, shopping, parking)

## Key Deliverables

- **Unified Design System** - Consistent visual language across all digital touchpoints while respecting each airport's unique identity
- **Flight Search** - Easy-to-use flight lookup with real-time status
- **Interactive Maps** - Terminal maps with points of interest and wayfinding
- **Mobile-First Approach** - Designed for travelers on the move

## Impact

- Improved passenger satisfaction scores
- Reduced wayfinding-related inquiries at information desks
- Created a scalable framework for future airport digital improvements
