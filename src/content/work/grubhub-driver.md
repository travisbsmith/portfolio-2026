## Overview

**My Role:** Design director, design manager, individual contributor, strategy, feature definition, road mapping, creative direction, stakeholder management

The Grubhub for Drivers application has been around since 2015. I started on the team in 2016 with the version 3.0 update. We are currently working on a v4 redesign. Since 2016 we have grown from 1000 to 60k+ drivers in 1k+ markets nation wide delivering 40k+ orders per day.

The team has had 2-5 designers supporting 3 product managers and a dedicated dev team of 8 native app engineers. I like to explain the Grubhub for Drivers app as Lyft for burritos. The app is a single point of communication for all order, schedule, payment and driver issues.

The following screens are a high-level overview of the leaps we have made in the app experience.

## Previous App and Updated App Screens

The most important update was the shift in mental model from orders to tasks. The idea is to guide our drivers and empower them to make the decisions that work best for them.

## Driver Scheduling

We added an in-app scheduling feature, along with an animated how-to when Drivers first go to the Scheduling section.

## Delivery Process Flow

We regularly work through journey mapping exercises. This is a very recent example that outlines all the touch points for an order that is working perfectly.
