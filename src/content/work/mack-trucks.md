## Overview

**Agency:** VSA Partners

While at VSA Partners, I led the UX design for Mack Trucks (a division of Volvo Group). The project involved creating a digital platform to help fleet customers manage their commercial vehicles, including a responsive website redesign and asset management platform.

## The Challenge

Fleet managers were using multiple disconnected systems to:
- Track vehicle locations and status
- Schedule maintenance
- Monitor driver behavior
- Manage fuel consumption
- Research and configure new trucks

## My Role

- Led UX strategy and design for the platform
- Designed responsive web experience for MackTrucks.com
- Created mega menu navigation for complex product catalog
- Designed parts ordering and truck configuration tools
- Built design system for enterprise applications

## Responsive Website

The new MackTrucks.com was designed to be fully responsive, serving both fleet managers researching trucks at their desks and drivers accessing resources on mobile devices in the field.

Key features included:
- Truck configurator and comparison tools
- Parts catalog with ordering capabilities
- Dealer locator with service scheduling
- Driver resources and training materials

## Results

- Improved user engagement across all device types
- Streamlined truck research and purchasing process
- Created foundation for future connected vehicle features
