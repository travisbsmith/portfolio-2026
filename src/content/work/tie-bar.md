## Overview

At The Tie Bar I led the Product Design and Engineering Team. The Tie Bar is focused on creating an online marketplace for guys to learn about, find and buy great accessories. We had **600,000+** unique visitors a month, with annual revenues of **$20M+**.

During my time at The Tie Bar the total conversion rate of the site increased by just over **0.5%** and by double digits for our mobile customers.

My team of product designers and engineers was focused on product innovation and providing improvements throughout the customer experience. We worked closely with our customers and with internal business departments to provide solutions to meet their unique needs.

**Core updates:** Full-site redesign with updating branding. Updated product detail page. Updated checkout process. Implementation of an agile design and development process.
