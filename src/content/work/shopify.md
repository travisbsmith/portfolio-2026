## Overview

**Role:** Design leadership, creative direction, stakeholder management, strategy

My time at Shopify has been focused on assisting merchants in effectively utilizing their valuable customer data in the most efficient and impactful ways possible. The talented team I am fortunate enough to collaborate with is responsible for the Shopify Admin interface's Customer, Marketing, and Analytics sections.

This dedicated team also owns and manages several first-party applications, including Shopify Email, Shopify Inbox, Shopify Forms, and Pixel Helper. These essential tools are integrated and used as part of our comprehensive Marketing Tools Suite.

Our collective efforts within the team aim to empower merchants to significantly reduce their overall customer acquisition costs while enhancing their overall lifetime value. Shopify is primarily structured as a powerful e-commerce platform; my team plays a crucial role in helping merchants extend their online stores to effectively discover and cultivate relationships with the most suitable customers in the proper channels.
