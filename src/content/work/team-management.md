## Team Philosophy + Processes

> My team philosophy is simple. Hire the best people and let them do their work. My job is to adapt and fill in gaps on the team. A functioning and happy team is the most clear indication that I am doing my job well.

Part of having a functioning and happy team is having repeatable processes that set good expectations for the team. Below is a collection of some of the tools and processes I have helped to create and implement during my time at Grubhub.

## Hiring Guide

I worked with a small team to formalize our hiring process from recruiting through on-boarding with a focus on setting the right expectations from the beginning of the process and also making sure to give both sides enough time to truly understand each other before moving forward.

## Growth Guide

At the beginning of 2019 I worked with 2 designers on my team to completely revamped our team Leveling Documentations into a Growth Guide. The goal of this work is to provide clarity, consistency and visibility into how we evaluate members of the design team.

## Design Review

Our design team was suffering from very unproductive design reviews. A Q1 goal was to make Design Reviews more helpful for the design team and find a more productive way to bring our stakeholders into the review process.

This need led to a revamp of our design review process to include a more structured presentation format and also introduced Design Salons for more unstructured design time. The key was to have a repeatable process for designers to get design feedback. Prompting them to think about the keys to a good design review - context, project stage, feedback needed, goal/metric of the feature.

## Design Process

> "Clearly identify the problem, think through as many solutions as you can and build the one that works the best. I am here to support my design team in their process. To ask questions, clear a path and ensure they are pushing in the right areas at the right time."
