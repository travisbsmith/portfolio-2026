## Overview

**Role:** Design leadership, creative direction, stakeholder management, strategy

Restaurants are the heart of Grubhub. Additionally, the more restaurants we have on Grubhub the better the experience is for our Diners. The previous Restaurant onboarding process was a form that sent an internal email and kicked off an extremely manual internal process to get restaurants on the platform. This process touched 6+ internal people and took 21 days on average. Most importantly, this process is not scalable to help with long-term, future growth.

The **goal** of this project was to significantly reduce the time it takes to get a restaurant on the platform and also reduce the internal effort to 0.

After many months of design, testing, and building, the **new self-service onboarding process** has no internal effort and can get a restaurant on the platform in less than 72 hours.

## Existing Process Flow

Existing onboarding process - this process has 6+ internal touch points and takes on average 21 days. This process was the result of several siloed teams working without coordination and led to many delays and missed communications during this critical process.

## Existing Marketing Site

The existing onboarding flow starts with this marketing site and form. The form information is then emailed to an internal email. This onboarding process did not take into consideration who was filling out this form or what was going to be done with the information after it was collected.

## New Process Flow

After spending time with our internal stakeholders and restaurant partners, and then working through our design process the team developed the following process flow. This flow was the map that the team used to guide the rest of our design and operations work.

## New Marketing Site

After trying several marketing pages, with varying levels of information collection, this simple version was the ultimate "winner" based on conversion rate. The value proposition and clear call to action were the keys to getting the right restaurant partners into the onboarding process with realistic expectations.

## New Onboarding Web App

The new restaurant self service onboarding app allows our restaurant partners to provide Grubhub with all the information they need to get onto Grubhub accurately and quickly. Giving control to the restaurants reduced internal handling times, errors and the potential for lost contacts. The new onboarding web app is fully responsive and built with components and styles from our Grubhub for Restaurants product. This initial interaction with the styles helps set expectations about what they will encounter when they are fully signed up and using Grubhub.
